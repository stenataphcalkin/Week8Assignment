# Reflection
### Thoughts -
I expected to be relieved to no longer need to use my number 1 problem, but Vercel has removed SO MUCH stress from my projects.

I only had the one major error with Vercel, and that was needing to update my password following the issue troubleshooted with Bertie and Manny following the demonstration of my "ability to find unique problems", which was resolved in class.

The biggest point of confusion was remembering which page.js was which, and a few times I had placed codes for the posts vs [postId] page.js' the wrong way round.

Otherwise, the troubles mostly faced were remembering what assets were named what from one page to the other, or doing them backwards such as comment_content.comment or using the const names across all and having to retweak them upon review.

Following previous weeks troubles with Render, I wanted to give myself a bit of time to focus on reading up more on how things work, doing more of a deep drive on Next, knowing that there was likely going to be fewer errors, leaving things with basic theming so focus more on function and achieving all base goals. Between this, and time limitations from trying to give myself more of a balance between chill and study time over the weekend, I did run out of time to implement the images API as intended, and left a nod to it with a single image on the home page.

As discussed with Corinna in class, I feel that once the course is over that it will be very beneficial to visit the assignments again in my own time for structure and goals, and to generate much more complete portfolio pieces.

One issue I need to look into deeper is seeing how text is rendered from the API and if that can be structured with markdown or similar to that. As well looking into tools in Excel, sheets, etc. that will allow me to mass-change special characters to next.js friendly ones such as &apos; as these were struck out of the text purely for the demo.

Whilst there was a lot of referring to materials and reading up on things, it will definitely take me a while to recall these entirely, but the structure makes much more sense to me on paper, even if there is confusion between where I am in the file structure due to the constant page.js' etc. Even then, this has felt far, far less stressful.

Which has me terrified, yet hopeful.

# Goals

### Base Requirements

- ✅ Display all posts on the page, with an option to sort them in ascending or descending order.
- ✅ Create a SQL schema for a posts table and a comments table, with the comments being connected to the posts table with a foreign key.
  - ✅ Please submit your database schema, as is mentioned in the submission instructions.
- ✅ Create a delete button on posts that allows users to delete the post from the database.
- ✅ Create a form which saves comments to a dedicated comments table, with the comments being connected to the posts table with a foreign key.
- ✅ Allow users to comment on individual posts in their dynamic routes. Comments should be associated with posts, and have a dynamic route (e.g. `/posts/:postid`).
- ✅ Add a `redirect` when a user creates a post to redirect them to the posts page.
